[quote=About this mod]I think I refused to make the abilities of this mod a lot of time because they were too "small" things and didn't really make sense in any context... Anyway some of them are really useful so I decided to pack them together into this mod ^^ If you have any other idea of thing that should be removed in this game, feel free to propose them in the comments and I may add them to this mod ;)
